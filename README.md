1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	In the main, we created the array list to store the dogs, 3 new dog objects and the comparator.

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?
The comparator constructor call is in the Collections.sort() method, because the Comparator class is defined in the imported comparator interface.
